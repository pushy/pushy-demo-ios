# pushy-demo-ios

A demo of the [Pushy iOS SDK](https://pushy.me/docs/ios/get-sdk) integrated into a sample iOS app.

> [Pushy](https://pushy.me/) is the most reliable push notification gateway, perfect for real-time, mission-critical applications.

This app registers your device to receive push notifications and assigns it a unique token, which you can copy and paste into the [demo page](https://pushy.me/docs/resources/demo) to send yourself a test push notification.
